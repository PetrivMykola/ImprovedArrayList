# ImprovedArrayList
You need to implement a collection of integers that allows you to perform operations:
- add-ons
- deletion
- item search by value
- search for an item by index
- search for the maximum element
- search for the minimal element
- search of the arithmetic mean of all elements

At the same time:
- When adding a new element, all the elements increase their value to the added item
- when removed - reduce their value to the deleted element

We can not enter null, symbols, and other values in the collection, except integer numbers.

For use this collection you need just create instance of collection!!!
